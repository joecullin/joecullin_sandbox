Usually I put this sort of thing in Evernote, in a note that looks like a long journal: a mix of notes, example code & config, conversations & meetings, etc., mostly in time/date order.

Trying something new: put the code & config into git, with notes in markdown.

Benefits over evernote:
- Easier for me to revisit and tweak: quick setup in a clean new dir.
- Easier to share: I'll be careful to separate keys & env details (don't want those in git), so I won't hesitate to share with others.

Downsides:
- Harder for me to do quick universal searches.
- Slower editing, less flexible formatting.

If this doesn't pan out, I can always copy all interesting files back into evernote.
